## 1.1 Why ML?
- Develop strengths for the job market
## 1.2 ML Pipeline

> Way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model.

- Model training is only a small piece of the machine learning process
- Creating successful machine learning systems involves a lot more than choosing between a random forest model and a support vector machine model
- E.g.: 
	- Input data: furry + barks
	- Output data: dog

***Problem Definition***
- For a given loan, will it be repaid or not? 
- When will the loan be repaid? 
- How much money will be received from a given loan? 
- What will be the profit made on a given loan? 
- What will be the profit made on a given loan without using disallowed input features?

***Data Ingestion***
- What data provider or vendor should we use? Can they be trusted?
- How will it be ingested?
- Should it be stored as a file or in a database?
