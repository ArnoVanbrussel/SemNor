## 1.1 Why ML?
- Develop strengths for the job market
## 1.2 ML Pipeline

> Way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model.

- Model training is only a small piece of the machine learning process
- Creating successful machine learning systems involves a lot more than choosing between a random forest model and a support vector machine model
- E.g.: 
	- Input data: furry + barks
	- Output data: dog
## 1.3 Steps in a ML pipeline
- Problem Definition
- Data Ingestion
- Data Preparation
- Data segregation
- Model training
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment
- Performance Monitoring
