# 1 Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Supervised = Task driven (regression/classification)
> Supervised learning refers to the process of building a machine learning model that is based on **labeled training data**

- Unsupervised = Data driven (clustering)
> Unsupervised learning refers to the process of building a machine learning model **without relying on labeled training data**
